    "# Mini-R1: Reproduce Deepseek R1 „aha moment“ a RL tutorial \n",
    "\n",
    "The release of Deepseek R1 shocked the industry. Why? Well, DeepSeek-R1 is an open model that rivals OpenAI's o1 in complex reasoning tasks, introduced using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and RL-focused multi-stage training approach. They not only released the model, but also a research paper on how they did it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper they described an \"aha moment\" when using pure RL to train the model. During this phase, DeepSeek-R1-Zero (the first test of DeepSeek-R1) learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial approach without any human feedback or data describing how to do it.  They describe this as an \"aha moment\" as:\n",
    " \n",
    "> This behavior is not only a testament to the model’s growing reasoning abilities but also a captivating example of how reinforcement learning can lead to unexpected and sophisticated outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It serves as a powerful reminder of the potential of RL to unlock new levels of intelligence in artificial systems, paving the way for more autonomous and adaptive models in the future. In this blog post we want to recreate the small \"aha moment\" of DeepSeek-R1 using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and the Countdown Game. We will train an open model using reinforcement learning trying to teach it self-verification and search abilities all on its own to solve the Countdown Game. The Countdown game is a numbers puzzle where players use a set of randomly drawn numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷) to reach or get as close as possible to a target number.\n",

    "Available Numbers: 25, 50, 75, 100, 3, 6\n",
    "\n",
    "(100 × (3 × 3)) + (50 + 6 / 3) = 952\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The blog post includes an interactive code which you can run in a Jupyter Notebook on how to train a model using GRPO and Q-Lora. This is a great way to learn how to use TRL and GRPO, but it is very slow and requires a lot of compute. Additionally, I added a [script](https://github.com/philschmid/deep-learning-pytorch-huggingface/blob/main/training/scripts/run_r1_grpo.py) and instructions to run the training on Node with multiple GPUs or a SLURM cluster. \n",

    "## Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\n",
    "\n",
    "Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a reinforcement learning algorithm to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. It was introduced in the [DeepSeekMath](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300) paper in the context of mathematical reasoning. GRPO modifies the traditional Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by eliminating the need for a value function model. Instead, it estimates baselines from group scores, reducing memory usage and computational overhead. GRPO, now also used by the Qwen team, can be used with rule/binary-based Rewards as well as General Reward Models to improve models on helpfulness. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sampling**: Generate multiple outputs for each prompt using the current policy\n",
    "2. **Reward Scoring**: Each generation is scored using a reward function, could be (rule-based or outcome-based)\n",
    "3. **Advantage Calculation**: The average reward of the generated outputs is used as a baseline. The advantage of each solution within the group is then computed relative to this baseline. The reward is normalized within a group.\n",
    "4. **Policy Optimization**: The policy tries to maximize the GRPO objective, which includes the calculated advantages and a KL divergence term. This is different from how PPO implements the KL term within the reward.\n",

    "<think> First, I need to think about the numbers we have: 14, 70, and 80. To get 85, I think 80 might be a good starting point because it's right in between 85. If I subtract or add 80, it won't lead to 85 easily. Next, 70 seems to be a good intermediate number, especially to use in conjunction with 14. \n",
    "Now, I can think about different combinations using addition, subtraction and multiplication/division. If I take 80 - 70 = 10, which is not needed. So, I need to find a way to use 14. If I subtract 14 from 80, I get 66, which still isn't 85. If I subtract 70 from 80, I get 10 again, this isn't constructive yet. \n",
    "Multiplication could create numbers larger than the target 85. Let's consider division: If I divide 70 by 14, I get 5. Then if I add this result to 80, I get 85. This combination seems promising: 80 - (70 / 14) = 80 - 5 = 75, this still isn't quite right. Let me correct my approach: Let's use division and then addition. If I take 80 / (70 / 14) → 80 / 5 = 16, and then 80 - 16 = 64, still incorrect. Let me simplify: 80 / (70 / 14) → 80 / 5 = 16, and then 80 - 16 gives 64 again, let me correct: 80 - (70 / 14) → 80 - 5 = 75, but I need 85. Thus I will use the combinations in a slightly different order to insert numbers: I get 80 + (70 / 14) = 80 + 5 = 85</think>\n",

    "<think> First, I need to consider how I can use the numbers 1, 21, and 90 to reach 68. I can try different combinations of operations. Let's try to use subtraction and addition. If I subtract 90 from 21, I get -69, which is too far from 68. Now, if I add 1 to 90, I get 91, which is also not right. Another way is to see what happens if I subtract 21 from 90, which gives me 69. This is closer but still not 68. Let me use multiplication instead of subtraction. 90 * 1 = 90. Now, if I try to reduce this slightly by subtracting 21, I am not getting close to 68.\n",
    "Now, let's try another multiplication. I'll think of 1 * (larger value) + (smaller value). Let's try 1 * 90 + 21. This evaluates to 90 + 21 = 111, which is too much. Instead, I will try: 90 / 1 + 21 - 7. But this gives a division by 7, which seems complex. Let's re-evaluate: I'll use 1 to divide 21: 21 / 1 = 21. Now, subtract 21 from 90, and add 1, we have 90 - 21 = 69, using one...\n",

    "The release of DeepSeek R1 and its research paper might be breakpoint for the open-science and open-source development. Just a week after DeepSeek release, we've been able to reproduce a simple version of R1 learned \"reasoning\" using GRPO and the Countdown Game. While our implementation focuses on a specific task rather than general reasoning and convergence into a very specific \"reasoning\" format, it shows that the method is working. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our mini R1 experiment we used GRPO, with two rule-based reward but already required significant compute: 4 H100 GPUs running for 6 hours to complete just 450 training steps on a 3B parameter model. This gives us an idea of the compute needs that you will need to scale Reinforcement Learning. Deepseek ran a 671B model for over 8000 steps and they probably did many ablations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking in to 2025, it's clear that we are on the cusp of even more significant progress. RL will become more accessible and user-friendly, more researchers and developers will explore its potential, but also require amount of more compute as before and compared to supervised fine-tuning. \n",
